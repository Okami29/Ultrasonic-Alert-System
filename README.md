# Ultrasonic-Alert-System
This ESP32 project hosts a web server to monitor an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. Users set a distance limit, and if the measured distance falls below it, the webpage turns red and an LED lights up. When the distance returns to a safe range, the webpage resets, and the LED turns off, providing real-time alerts.
